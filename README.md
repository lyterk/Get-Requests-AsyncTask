### Why?

This is mostly a stepping-stone project for myself. I'd like to make
more complex Android projects in the future, and I'd like to figure
how to do simple, modular things first (e.g. instantiate an
AsyncTask,or send an HTTP request to some site).

### For what?

The project I have in mind is a GPS tracking app, similar in nature to Strava,
that tracks where a bicyclist with a phone might be at any given time.
